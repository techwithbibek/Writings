__Structure: Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? ( Asking for opinion )__

Does the sum of the advantages carries greater weight/ greater importance/ greater significance than the sum of the disadvantages?

Tips: Write only one advantage and one disadvantage because you have to 

Steps:
1. Brainstorm both sides.
2. Clearly state your opinion in the thesis statement (e.g., “In my opinion, the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages.”).

ExampleQuestion:
In recent years, more and more people are choosing to read e-books rather than paper
books.

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?

Sample Introduction:

An increasing number of people are using e-books as a reading tool, such as Kindle, instead
of traditional paper books. I believe there are significant benefits to using e-books over paper
books with only a few minor drawbacks.

Sample 2:

Example Question:
In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people travelling inside these vehicles will be passangers. Do you think the
advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?


Body Paragraph 1:

(One of the disadvantages)

Topic sentence: Employment losses

Explanation:

Example(s):

Why this is unimportant: I want to mention that it has disadvantage but it is of less important/isnt significant because we have a remedy such as)

Another sample: However, I donot think this is a major disadvantage for ... as long as they ... solution.



Opinion: Advantages outweigh the disadvantages

(__Topic sentence__)One downside of self-driving cars might be that they could lead to large employment losses. (__explanation with example__) Nowadays, in many countries, a great number of people are making a living by driving, be 
they truckers, bus drivers, or delivery couriers. Imagine all these people are made redundant by autonomous cars. That would raise the unimployment rates in these countries significantly. (__Make it less significance__) 
However, I think this can be avoided if drivers reskill to get themselves a job in a new sector. (__by offering a solution to overcome the disadvantage__)

Body Paragraph 2:

(One of the advantages)

Topic sentence: Help businesses cut costs

Explanation:

Example(s):

Why this is a great advantage: why this advantage carries so much weight: ( try to find the bigger picture related to society/country/world >> what benefits can this advantages bring to society?

another sample: I think this creates a greate advantage for a country because .... offers people....

(__Topic sentence__)On the positive side, driverless cars could help businesses reduce operating expenses. (__explanation on how?__) This is because, with these cars, they would not 
need to hire drivers to deliver their products or services to their customers. For instance, the American logistics company UPS currently has hundreds of thousands of truck drivers
and pays them an average of 60,000 dollars per year, which adds up to tens of billions of dollars anually. Replacing these drivers with autonomous cars would mean that these huge 
salary payments could be eliminated. (__Make it more significance with bigger picture__)<ins>I think this could create a great advantage for society as a whole because companies could devote the money 
they save on labor to other aspects of their business, which could mean cheaper, better goods for consumers.</ins>

Introduction: 

--paraphrase

--opinion + main ideas

In the future, all vehicles will be autonomous. Passangers will be the only people inside them. I believe businesses could cut costs by using driverless cars, and this advantage far outweighs any 
potential disadvantages.  


Conclusion: 

--opinion + main ideas

In conclusion, __idea1__ although self-driving vehicles would result in many job losses, __Opinion__ I believe this downside is greatly outweighted by the upside that __idea 2__ these vehicles could help businesses save operating costs.


# Structure: Agree/Disagree ? ( Asking for opinion )__

Question type: “To what extent do you agree or disagree?”

If there is to what extent, then you need to write completely/ toally agree or disagree

Thesis Statement Options:
- I strongly agree with this view because (reason 1 + reason 2).
- I strongly disagree with this view because (reason 1 + reason 2).
- I partially agree with this view as (reason 1), but at the same time (reason 2).
Structure:
- Introduction (background + thesis)

- Body 1 (main reason 1)
- Body 2 (main reason 2)
- Conclusion (restate opinion)

Example Question: Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

1. Use "completely" or "totally" to respond to "to what extent"
2. Fully understand the question
3. Do not ignore the thing you disagree with. ( if you agree with railways you also need to talk about roads ) ( Compare the thing you agree with, with the thing you disagree with ) best option is to expand topic sentence by with comparing sentences

Body paragraph 1: Encourage green travel

Funding railways encourages green travel. __comparing__ Improving roads may result in an increase in car use. However, if governments build more subway or tram lines to make it easir for people to take them to get around, more people
will choose them rather than private cars as their major means of travel. __why?__ This is good for the environment because __subway and tram trains__ have a much larger capacity and therefore much lower per-capita carbon emissions than
__private vehicles__.

Body paragraph 2: Economic activity __once you have a topic sentence and explanation, you need to cover both in you example, not just topic senetence.__

Railway networks are crucial for economic activity. This is because, with these networks connecting different cities and even countries, goods can be shipped fast and cost-effectively. Take for example, the China-Europe Railway Express, 
which moves cargo containers from China to London in only 18 to 19 days. This is roughly half the transit time of an ocean container, and the cost is around ten times cheaper than making use of air freight. This means that goods can be delivered
in time with relatively low costs from source to consumtion for Black Fridays or for any other promotional activities that take place in the UK.

Introduction:

__Paraphrase__ It is argued that  governments should invest money in railways instead of roads, __opinion__ I completely agree with this point of view because __two main points__ railways are more environmentally friendly and also play
a key role in economic activity.

Conclusion:

__Restate you opinion and the two main ideas__ In conclusion, government spending should be on railways rather than roads. For one thing, better raiway services encourages eco-friendly travel and, for another, they they play a big part in economic
activity.

Note; there can be other ways to address this question. for instance just give two main body and adress all the question aksed. 


# Discuss Both Sides and Give Your Opinion

Introduction: your opinion

Body paragraph 1: Discuss other people's opinion + your opinion

Body paragraph 1: Discuss other people's opinion + your opinion

Conclusion: Your opinion

Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion.

Body paragraph 1:  the side we disagree with: Why some people like to stay same. give reasons as two main ideas

People who resist change may be too afraid of the risks involved. Take, for example, those who choose to stay in a low-paying job they hate. They may fear that if they resign, they may be unable to find a new job, thus
losing the stability their old one provides. __Opinon why i disagree__ However, I do not think maintaining the status quo can help them avoid risks. Sooner or later, they will lose their low-level jobs to automation. In fact, as the
billinaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel said, "in the world that's changing  so quickly, the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk."

Body paragraph 2: the side we agree with: Why change is always good

Others, on the other hand, argue that change is always good thing because it is the only way to succeed in the long run. __example__ If super successful  people and organizations are examined, it will be found that they all
have one thing in common: They keep trying new things. They are willin to experiment and fail a lot in order to innovate. This may have downsides in the short term but allows them to remain relevant and competitive over longer
periods of time. __Opinion why I agree__ I agree with this argument because, as discussed above, if a person is stagnant for the sake of short-term comfort, they will be guaranteed to fail in the longer term.


Introduction: 

There are competing views on whether to make changes in life. Although change always involves risks, I still think that it is always good to make changes because, in the long run, people will gain more from the changes they made
than they lose.

Conclusion:

In conclusion: although a shift in direction comes with risks, in the long run people will benefit from the shift they made. Therefore, I believe change is always a good thing when thinking long term.
